# S-DSRC_Protocol_Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the S-DSRC (Secure Dedicated Short Range Communication) protocol for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) using OMNeT++ and SUMO. The simulation includes bidirectional data transfer between nodes and a cloud server, as well as between the Road Side Unit (RSU) and the cloud server, alongside cryptographic implementations.

## Requirements
- OMNeT++ (version 6.0.3)
- SUMO (version 1.20.0)
- Veins (version 5.2)
- Inet (version 4.5.2)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/WashifAkhtar/S-DSRC_protocol_simulation.git`
2. Import s-dsrc project directory in your OMNeT++ workspace.
3. Build project.
4. Run the simulation.

## Usage
1. Open the project in OMNeT++ IDE.
2. Set up the simulation parameters in the `.ini` files.
3. Compile the project.
4. Run the simulation.
