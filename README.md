# S-DSRC_Protocol_Simulation


Overview

This project simulates the S-DSRC (Secure Dedicated Short Range Communication) protocol for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) using OMNeT++ and SUMO. The simulation includes bidirectional data transfer between nodes and a cloud server, as well as between the Road Side Unit (RSU) and the cloud server, alongside cryptographic implementations.


Requirements

OMNeT++ (version 6.0.3)

SUMO-gui (version 1.20.0)

Veins (version 5.2)

Inet (version 4.5.2)
